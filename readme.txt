This research repository constain all needed to run my assignment for the course of Bayesian Statistics (2020-2021) 
of the master Methodology and Statistics for the Social, Behavioural and Biomedical Sciences at Utrecht University. 
To do so, the df.csv contains tha data used for the analysis, which is the only thing you need to be able to follow the 
manuscript.rmd, containing all the details of the report. There is also the pdf version of the manuscript.

Improvements *coming soon*.
